All relevant data for the article on diffusion-aware voltage source

Source codes implement 1) the Diffusion-aware voltage source and shell ECM in Section 3, and 2) parameterization and prediction of shell ECM in Section 4.

To run the SPM simulation within PyBaMM, pre-install pybamm package available at https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM

Experimental data files are of size exceeding GitHub's file size limit; thus, they are available upon request (mzhuo@connect.ust.hk).
